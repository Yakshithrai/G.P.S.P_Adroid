# The Gram Panchayat Services app is an essential tool for local government administration in India. It aims to provide a platform that connects citizens and the members of Panchayat. With the help of this app, citizens can easily lodge complaints, track ongoing projects, and receive updates on upcoming events or programs. The project will cover the necessary features and functionalities, including the admin and user modules, login, complaint registration, ongoing projects, upcoming events, and contact details. The app will also have an admin module to manage user details and update the latest government schemes.
